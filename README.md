# Schwarzschild Black Hole Visualization

This repository contains Python and GLSL shader code to generate visualizations of a Schwarzschild black hole. The Schwarzschild black hole is a non-rotating, uncharged black hole, and this project uses ray tracing techniques to simulate the gravitational lensing effects around it.

## Results

Example images and videos generated by this project can be found in the `examples` folder within the repository.

Here are some examples of the kind of images this project generates:

Feel free to explore the [examples](examples) folder for more visualizations.

## Usage

### Development Environment

The development environment is managed with [Poetry](https://www.python-poetry.org). To install it run:
```bash
pip install poetry
```

### How to install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pedropasa03/bh-testing.git
   cd bh-testing
   ```
   
2. Activate poetry shell:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
   
And everything will be up and running.

### How to generate images

In the [project folder](bh_testing) you can find a `main.py` file. If executed, it will generte four example images, including the images shown in the Results section.

```bash
pyhon bh_testing/main.py
```

You can edit the file to your liking and use your own textures if you want.


## References

I took the main idea from this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjWjZFwz3rQ) and I verified the equations from this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_geodesics). I also used the [Rodrigues' rotation formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigues%27_rotation_formula) and the [sphere UV coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping).
